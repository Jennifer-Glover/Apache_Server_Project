        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.

                                ## OTHER NOTES ### 
 ### The force to HTTPS and the rewrite to final.cit384 works for mywebsite and special. 
 ## BUT it does not ask for the password when visiting submission, it goes into the directory.
